# About Me

I am Morgan A. Keith, I received my Bachelor's in Psychology from OU where I was a club gymnast and part of a team that won 2x National Champions. I achieved individual accolades as a gymnast, and as a coach had the opportunity to coach boy's gymnastics who also earned State and Regional accolades. After my 20 years in the gymnastics community, I was an Inventory Specialist where I improved production processes and safety. I enjoyed training new hires and using my investigative skills to solve inventory discrepancies, but I found working with data to solve and predict workflow and production issues to be what intrigued me. From here, I discovered my love of Data Science and joined Flatiron to improve my data analytics skills, build machine learning models, and create visuals to convey my findings. Now, I pursue my passion for Data Science by continuously learning and improving on new skills, as well as building projects.

### Projects

#### Predicting Delivery Status 
Use Python to create classification models that predict delivery status as Advanced, On Time, or Late
- Extract Data (170k+), clean, filter, and aggregate data for quantitative analysis
- Work independently and decision-making to strategize the project and Powerpoint presentation
- Implemented supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) through pipelines to achieve highest accuracy test results (0.86) on classification models


#### Housing Price Prediction 
Use Python to create SARIMA models to predict housing trends.
- Extract data and data management such as clean and filter data for quality assurance
- Performed a quantitative analysis and visualization housing price trends in the Houston,TX area
- Predictive analytics on housing prices 3 years in advance with the confidence interval to represent risk



#### Airline Delays 
Use Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict a flightâ€™s delay for selected destinations.
- Use dataset of 160k+ for quantitative analysis and use supervised learning models predictive classification
- Normalize and standardize data for accurate and quality modeling
- Used XGBoost for gradient descent ability to decrease loss and predict delays with an increase accuracy (.74)
