# About Me

I am Morgan A. Keith a Data Scientist with a Bachelor’s and programming skills for data manipulation, data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning. My background as a gymnast and a coach led me to develop exceptional team-building and decision-making skills in goal-oriented environments to drive best results. I am well-versed in best practices for business requirements and integrity, as well as data science functions including predictive analytics.


### Projects

#### Predicting Delivery Status 
Use Python to create classification models that predict delivery status as Advanced, On Time, or Late
- Extract Data (170k+), clean, filter, and aggregate data for quantitative analysis
- Work independently and decision-making to strategize the project and Powerpoint presentation
- Implemented supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) through pipelines to achieve highest accuracy test results (0.86) on classification models

#### Airline Delays 
Use Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict a flight’s delay for selected destinations.
- Use dataset of 160k+ for quantitative analysis and use supervised learning models predictive classification
- Normalize and standardize data for accurate and quality modeling
- Used XGBoost for gradient descent ability to decrease loss and predict delays with an increase accuracy (.74)
