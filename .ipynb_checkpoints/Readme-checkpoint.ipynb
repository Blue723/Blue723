    "I am Morgan Keith, I use data science to predict classifications for data with machine learning techniques. As a former gymnast and coach I worked in a team and taught others based on their strengths. I worked in inventory which required creatively finding and solving errors in the process. I use these skills to work in a team to creatively solve problems while building machine learning models.\n"
